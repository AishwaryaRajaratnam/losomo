the extractor is stripped and included in the app.py/tipreader.what you have to do is make it a list and take the union and store it as usual.

But the problem is
 the result of the extractor() is a 2D array

>> list = extractor("For all problems with you mobile-akash mobile shop")
>>> print list
[('shop', 1, 1), ('mobile-akash', 1, 1), ('problem', 1, 1)]
>>> print list[0]
('shop', 1, 1)
>>> print list[0][0]
shop


so you can access the right tag by taking the list[0][0]
1)So make a list that consist of taglist 
2)do the union and
3) store it
